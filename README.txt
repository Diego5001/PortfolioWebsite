My Portfolio

- DESCRIPTION

    - So this is my website that tells of the previous projects that I have done in the past.

- DESIGN

    - So the layout of this website I tried with all the knowledge to make it most easy possible to make changes and since this is a
    simple website the it is very easy to navigate around it. As right now it, you could just click the header button so see what I have
    done.
    After the MVP I will style the website to have more tween and, improved borders and colors because they are terrible color choice as right now.
