My Portfolio

- DESCRIPTION

    - So this is my website that tells of the previous projects that I have done in the past.

- DESIGN

    - So the layout of this website I tried with all the knowledge to make it most easy possible to make changes and since this is a
    simple website the it is very easy to navigate around it. As right now it, you could just click the header button so see what I have
    done.
    After the MVP I will style the website to have more tween and, improved borders and colors because they are terrible color choice as right now.

- MVP
    - This the 'MVP' elements I choose for the website for now since they are the required stuff to make it look like my Portfolio

- CONTACT
    - The way you can contact me is when you reach the home page which you start there in the webstie, you either press 'contact' button
     below the little more about me or press the other 'contact' button in the header. And when you reach the contacts page you either
     gmail by the gmail I left there or use the gmail system I made (Which in the MVP is not working right now)

- STRUGGLES?

    - I kind of struggled since I don't really use html but likely most of the people that have done their portfolio had very know knowledge
    but I did good.

- AFTER MVP

    - Besides the enhancements I'll add, I will add like hidden fun facts about personal likes. Like you press a very small circle and
    my likes will appear.
